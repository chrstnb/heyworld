### a collection of resources for people who are new to programming

# processing
Processing is an awesome place to start; you can create a lot of cool multimodal
projects with it while learning fundamentals of programming.

You'll be working in an **IDE (integrated development environment)** in which
you can write and run code.
[Download it & find other great resources here](https://processing.org/)

[Here's](https://gist.github.com/chrstnb/aac79def0b3ab63bc5cadc249fdb4901.js) a little
template to get you up and running.

There's an exceptional book that will walk you through the basics of creating
cool things with processing and some programming basics too. There are newer
editions if you're interested in buying a copy [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1457187086/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1457187086&linkCode=as2&tag=processing09-20&linkId=JEJC22CTQ5ZF4ZYO)
and [here's](http://cmuems.com/resources/getting_started_with_processing.pdf) a
pdf of an earlier edition.
